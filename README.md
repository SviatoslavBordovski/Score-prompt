# Score-prompt

Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
<br>
Score Grade
<br>
<table>
  <tr> <td> >= 0.9 A </td></tr>
  <tr> <td> >= 0.8 B </td></tr>
  <tr> <td> >= 0.7 C </td></tr>
  <tr> <td> >= 0.6 D </td></tr>
  <tr> <td> < 0.6 F </td></tr>
</table>
  <br>
If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85.
